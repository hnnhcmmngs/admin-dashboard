# admin-dashboard

This is an example of a user's dashboard for a fictional website. The purpose of this project is to become more familiar with building layouts using grid. Almost the entire website is built with grids and subgrids, with the exception of a few elements that were hard to style with grid and so use flexbox instead.

A live preview of the website can be accessed at: https://hnnhcmmngs.github.io/admin-dashboard/
